Detecting Traffic Rules Implementation inside Car (Seat Belt, Mobile Phone)

This is my project which i made for my final year in my univeristy this project is basically based on object detection, in which i am detecting the seatbelt and cellphone while driving, because both of these are the major issue which causes the casualities on road.

As per the Shopify Backend Internee Requirement. I am using different things in this project, which are:
i. Saving the Rule Violation Frame into the Database.
ii. Displying the Detected Frames in along with there Dues.
iii. Admin have option to delete the Record if there is any misconception occurs.

Due to less time i am uploading this project as a challenge because i gotta know about this early this morning when i was in my university. So please accept my appology and accept my code.
Thanks
